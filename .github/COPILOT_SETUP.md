# GitHub Copilot Setup

This project includes GitHub Copilot instructions to help Copilot understand the project structure, conventions, and workflows.

## What This Provides

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file provides GitHub Copilot with:

1. **Project Overview** - What this package does and its purpose
2. **Technology Stack** - Languages, frameworks, and tools used
3. **Development Setup** - How to install and configure the development environment
4. **Build, Test, and Lint Commands** - How to run common development tasks
5. **Code Style and Conventions** - Naming conventions, documentation standards
6. **Package Structure** - Directory organization and file purposes
7. **Agent-Based Model Structure** - Specific to this simulation model
8. **Shiny Application** - How the web interface is structured
9. **CI/CD Workflows** - Automated testing and deployment

## How to Use

GitHub Copilot automatically reads the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file when you use Copilot in this repository. This helps Copilot provide more accurate and context-aware suggestions that follow this project's conventions.

No additional setup is required - just use GitHub Copilot as normal in your IDE.

## For Copilot Workspace

If you're using GitHub Copilot Workspace, this file helps the agent:
- Understand the project structure better
- Follow established conventions
- Make appropriate suggestions for code changes
- Run the correct commands for building and testing

## Updating the Instructions

If you make significant changes to the project structure, conventions, or workflows, please update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to keep Copilot's understanding current.
