# GitHub Copilot Setup Steps for school.epi.abm
#
# This workflow configures the GitHub Copilot coding agent's environment
# by preinstalling R, pandoc, and all required dependencies.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment
# For detailed setup instructions, see .github/copilot-instructions.md
#
# This workflow aligns with the setup requirements documented in .github/copilot-instructions.md:
# - R version >= 4.0 (as specified in DESCRIPTION and copilot-instructions.md)
# - pandoc for building vignettes and documentation
# - All package dependencies managed via renv

name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

# Automatically run the setup steps when they are changed to allow for easy validation,
# and allow manual testing through the repository's "Actions" tab
